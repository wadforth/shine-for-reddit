# SHINE for Reddit (Unofficial) - 'Malware' fix!
The recent change to the chrome store has classed the extension Shine for Reddit (Unofficial) as malware. Since I use the extension daily, I needed to find a way to get it back. I don't plan on adding features, just fixing the 'malware' issue.

- Enable Developer Mode on your browser on extension page
- Download the repo
- Drag and drop folder into extension page
